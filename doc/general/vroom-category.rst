Synopsis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VROOM is an open-source optimization engine that aims at providing good solutions
to various real-life vehicle routing problems (VRP) within a small computing time.

VROOM can solve several well-known types of vehicle routing problems (VRP).

- TSP (travelling salesman problem)
- CVRP (capacitated VRP)
- VRPTW (VRP with time windows)
- MDHVRPTW (multi-depot heterogeneous vehicle VRPTW)
- PDPTW (pickup-and-delivery problem with TW)

VROOM can also solve any mix of the above problem types.


Characteristics
...............................................................................

VROOM models a Vehicle Routing Problem with ``vehicles``, ``jobs`` and ``shipments``.

The **vehicles** denote the resources that pick and/or deliver the jobs and shipments.
They are characterised by:

- Capacity on arbitrary number of metrics
- Skills
- Working hours
- Driver breaks
- Start and end defined on a per-vehicle basis
- Start and end can be different
- Open trip optimization (only start or only end defined)

The **jobs** denote the single-location pickup and/or delivery tasks, and the **shipments**
denote the pickup-and-delivery tasks that should happen within the same route.
They are characterised by:

- Delivery/pickup amounts on arbitrary number of metrics
- Service time windows
- Service duration
- Skills
- Priority

Terminologies
...............................................................................

- **Tasks**: Either jobs or shipments are referred to as tasks.
- **Skills**: Every task and vehicle may have some set of skills. A task can be
  served by only that vehicle which has all the skills of the task.
- **Priority**: Tasks may have some priority assigned, which is useful when all
  tasks cannot be performed due to constraints, so the tasks with low priority
  are left unassigned.
- **Amount (for shipment), Pickup and delivery (for job)**: They denote the
  multidimensional quantities such as number of items, weights, volume, etc.
- **Capacity (for vehicle)**: Every vehicle may have some capacity, denoting the
  multidimensional quantities. A vehicle can serve only those sets of tasks such
  that the total sum of the quantity does not exceed the vehicle capacity, at
  any point of the route.
- **Time Window**: An interval of time during which some activity can be
  performed, such as working hours of the vehicle, break of the vehicle, or
  service start time for a task.
- **Break**: Array of time windows, denoting valid slots for the break start of
  a vehicle.
- **Setup time**: Setup times serve as a mean to describe the time it takes to
  get started for a task at a given location.
  This models a duration that should not be re-applied for other tasks following
  at the same place.
  So the total "action time" for a task is ``setup + service`` upon arriving at
  a new location or ``service`` only if performing a new task at the previous
  vehicle location.
- **Service time**: The additional time to be spent by a vehicle while serving a
  task.
- **Travel time**: The total time the vehicle travels during its route.
- **Waiting time**: The total time the vehicle is idle, i.e. it is neither
  traveling nor servicing any task. It is generally the time spent by a vehicle
  waiting for a task service to open.
